# Drift Gillnet Fishery Analysis
 This repo includes the Python code for (1) identify fishing vs non-fishing records from the VMS, and (2) linear mixed-effects models that were used to test if vessels fish differently when an observer was onboard. For this analysis we compared metrics at the trip and set levels for the different vessel groups and seasons

This code was used in the analysis as described in the manuscript called "Comparing observed and unobserved fishing characteristics in the drift gillnet fishery for swordfish". Unfortunately, the data used in the analysis are confidential and access is restricted and cannot be provided.
